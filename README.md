# Jason Stitt's Blog

A Svelte app for my personal blog. I wrote about the process of creating this in [_Did switching to Svelte make my blog better?_](https://jasonstitt.com/svelte-blog) and decided to publish the code.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
